# Unit Command Climate Assessment and Survey System (UCCASS)

## What ?

UCCASS is an online survey platform written in PHP. It uses a MariaDB or MySQL compatible database to store results.

## Requirements

 * PHP 5.6/7/8
 * Webserver (probably: Apache)
 * MySQL or MariaDB database

## Installation

 * Create a database, e.g. MariaDB 
 * `cp survey.ini.php survey.ini.local.php` 
 * Edit survey.ini.local.php to have the right connection details. 
 * Visit http://youserver/install.php in a browser.

## Warning

Almost certainly requires future development and testing before it can be used in production as the code has not been maintained in ~10 years or so.

## Notes

See Section 2 of docs/index.html for installation instructions.
