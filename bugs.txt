    BUG #6: Surveys created with version 1.04
    will show literal HTML entitites in later
    versions when used with Text Only mode.
    i.e. a survey name with a double quote (")
    in it will show &quot; instead of the actual
    double quote. Fix is to decode all html entities
    in the existing data when upgraded (but this
    has not been implemented).
