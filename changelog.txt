    Added hashing (sha1) of passwords with salting; upgrade routine
    should convert as appropriate.

    Added logging/history of actions to provide auditability     

    Added 'uber-admin' behaviour, so normal admins cannot mess

  2004-08-22

    Updated ADOdb website listed in documentation

    Added upgrade from v1.06 to 1.8 option during installation

    Removed "administrator password" setting from survey.ini.php
    file. Default administrator user will now be created during
    the install process and added features allow other to be created.

    Added feature to reset completed survey records. This
    will not delete any provided answers, but resets the
    system to think users have not completed the surveys
    at all. Only applies to IP, UsernamePassword and
    Invitation Only access control types.

  2004-08-17

    Added access control setup to editsurvey.class.php.
    Access controls include None, IP, Cookie, Username
    and Password or Invitation Only.

    Added feature for surveys to be flagged as hidden. Hidden
    surveys will not show on main page at all and must
    be accessed directly by their URLs

    Added feature for results to be marked as public
    or private. If private, "View Results" columns
    appear on the User and Invitee list.

    Added feature for invite codes to be alphanumeric
    codes of a user-set length, i.e. "ab35swq4ST" or
    have the codes be two english words where each word
    is between 4 - 12 characters, i.e. "cilantro-randomly"
    or "windrowing-apprenticed". List of around 113,000
    words available for choosing is contained in utils/words.txt
    and was compiled from the Moby Word List by Grady Ward
    (http://www.gutenberg.net/etext/3201).

    Added feature to send Username and Password reminder by
    email to users and to send Invitation Notice to invitees.
    Email templates added to Default template

    Added ability to move users between the User list and Invitee
    list when using Invitation Only access control

    or Invitation information and the last date they completed the
    survey along with the total number of times they completed the survey.

    Changed new survey procedure to prompt for a default username
    and password for a user that'll be given edit privileges

  2004-07-28

    Fixed bug that prevented Matrix questions from being
    closed correctly when followed by an N, S or T answer type

    Rewrote editsurvey.class.php to separate the logic
    into individual methods instead of one huge function
    and complex switches

  2004-07-23

    Divided survey.class.php into individual classes
    to handle general actions of the survey system.
    Most classes inherit general functions from the Main
    class in main.class.php. Moved all class files to
    classes/ folder

    Separated "safe string" methods into a standalone
    class in safestring.class.php

    Added ability to create administrator users and users who
    have permission to create surveys from the Admin page.
    Name, email, username and password fields are available
    for each user. Users can be deleted from the same interface.

    Creating a new survey now presents a login form if
    create access is set to 'private' in survey.ini.php

    Removed private survey and private results drop downs
    from main survey page. All surveys (unless hidden) will
    be shown and users will be prompted for username/password
    or invitation code upon entering the survey or requesting
    the results.

    Removed survey access, results access and edit password
    settings from edit survey properties

  2004-07-15

    DB: Added "users" "users_sequence" and
        "taken_surveys" tables to database
        to keep track of users for access
        control and to track what and when
        surveys were taken by individual users

    DB: Added "hidden" column to "surveys" table

    Added "creation_access" setting to survey.ini.php
    file to control whether access to create new surveys
    is open to the public or restricted to administrators
    and the users they create and designate.

    Changed to use of ADOdb Quote() method instead
    of addslashes() for escaping text to be inserted
    into the database. Required changes in many queries
    to remove quotes around variables since Quote()
    supplies them automatically.

Version 1.06

  2004-07-18

    Fixed bug that added page breaks to surveys
    other than the one being edited when inserting
    new page breaks.

    Fixed bug that did not remove timing data
    when clearing the results of a survey

    Fixed bug for HTML labels on answer values to
    make them unique for each question based upon
    the question ID and the answer value ID

Version 1.05

  2004-07-13

    Added [Logout] link to main page to log out
    from administrator mode and editing surveys

    Added [?] and [Help] links on various pages
    linking to the documentation explaining
    those settings or actions

    Fixed bug that did not allow page breaks to
    be deleted from the beginning of surveys
    because of non-existant dependencies

    Added support for "Update Configuration Only"
    during installation process. This will allow you
    to re-run install.php but not have it update the
    database unless you choose to.

    Added ability to delete individual text answers
    from results page when logged in as administrator
    or logged in to edit the specific survey

    Updated documentation to include explanations
    of the new features since v1.04

    Modified upgrade script to work with new
    ADOdb features introduced in survey.class.php

  2004-07-07

    Replaced references to NULL values in
    queries to use ADOdb IfNull() method
    to be more compatible across different databases

    Added time tracking for completing survey
    and upon quitting survey. Results page
    now shows average, minimum and maximum
    completion time for the survey as well as
    the average time before quitting the survey.

    Added individual date format setting to each
    survey on survey properties page. Default
    setting is what's in survey.ini.php but his will
    allow it to be changed on a per-survey basis
    (for table results and CSV export).

    Added support for time limits on surveys in
    number of minutes. If the number of minutes
    is exceeded when the current survey page is submitted,
    then it will not be saved. All previous answers will
    be saved however. The user is shown a message
    if they exceed the time limit saying their last
    survey page was not saved.

    TPL: Modified message.tpl template (was not used
    prior to this)

    TPL: Added display of time limit and approximate
    elapsed time to take_survey.tpl

  2004-07-06

    Replaced all MySQL auto_increment and LIMIT
    dependant code to use ADOdb->GenID() and
    ->SelectLimit() to make the system compatible
    with more databases

    Changed date tracking in results and results_text
    tables to Unix timestamps to be compatible
    with more databases

    Added "date_format" setting to survey.ini.php
    file to control default date format for "table" and
    "CSV export" result viewing options. This setting
    also controls the display of the creation date
    on the survey properties page.

  2004-06-30

    Fixed bug in the date calculations for setting
    start and end dates of surveys

    Fixed bug in query using || instead of OR that
    will cause problems on database systems other than
    MySQL

    DB: Altered name of surveys.start
    and surveys.end columns to
    "start_date" and "end_date" to avoid using
    reserved words in some database systems

  2004-06-21

    New surveys created without copying an existing
    survey are now given a default set of answer
    types and values (matching Example Survey for now)

    Moved settings for file and html paths
    to survey.ini.php file. UCCASS still determines
    expected values at installation time so most
    installations should not need to edit these
    values. If the PHP method fails to detect the
    correct path then it can be corrected at
    installation time, however.

  2004-06-03

    Fixed bug to remove escaped characters from
    configuration data if magic_quotes_gpc is enabled

    Added new special_results class that inherits the
    main survey class to add a special "table" results
    view where each survey result is on it's own row. The
    class also adds the functionality to export to CSV.

    TPL: Added results_table.tpl to Default template. This
    template controls the layout of the "table" view of results.

    Added code to ensure filters were carried over to table results
    view and CSV export file

    TPL: Modified Copyright notice in main_footer.tpl in
    Default template

    Added SAFE_STRING_ESC constant that can be used to force
    escaping of data (using addslashes) that requires it (such as
    data read from the database that must be reinserted).

  2004-05-27

    Added 'Show' dependency. Show will override any
    'Hide' dependencies. The default action is to Show
    the question, so in order for this to be effective,
    you need two groups of dependencies: one to 'show'
    if answer is 1,2,3 and one to 'hide' if answer is
    4,5,6, for example. If 1 and 4 are chosen, the
    question will be shown.

    DB: Modified indexes on dependencies table to
    allow multiple dependencies on the same question
    and answer because of the 'Show' dependency

  2004-05-24

    Changed installation process to look for comments in
    the survey.sql file beginning with both '#' and '--'

    Updated documentation to reflect all changes to
    the survey system.

  2004-05-23

    Rewrote code inserting into the database or displaying
    user values to display according to the survey_text_mode
    and user_text_mode. survey_text_mode controls the
    text for the questions, answer_values and survey properties.
    user_text_mode controls anything coming from the user as an
    answer to the surveys. Options include Text Only, Limited HTML,
    and Full HTML. Limited HTML allows b, i, u, div, span, a, and img
    tags. Full HTML allows anything and IS A SECURITY RISK.
    Full HTML should not be used for user_text_mode and should
    only be used for survey_text_mode in a strictly controlled
    environment.

    Added use of {$html} and {$images_html} within any
    Limited HTML and Full HTML text modes.

    DB: Added 'survey_text_mode' and 'user_text_mode'
    int(11) not null default 0 columns to surveys table

    INI: Added setting to survey.ini.php file to
    administrative setting of survey_text_mode and
    user_text_mode. This defines the upper limit of
    what can actually be used within the system

    Added code to carry the port number in
    links if it's not 80 or 443.

    Fixed bug that would leave behind orphaned
    answer_values in the database when surveys
    were deleted.

  2004-05-19

    Fixed bug that caused the take_survey page to
    time out if certain dependency conditions were
    met (if last question on next page was determined
    to be "hidden" based upon current answers, then
    the next page of questions would not display).

  2004-05-17

    Fixed various errors in install process that
    would not recognize DELETE TABLE IF EXISTS
    queries in SQL file

    Added "New Installation" or "Upgrade" option
    to installation process.

    Database upgrade from v1.04 to v1.05 is automated
    within upgrades/upgrade_104_105.php file

    Added 'Lx' label to questions with 'N' answer
    type so they can be included in 'Insert after Number'
    list on Edit Survey Questions page. Resulted in
    Bug #2 being fixed.

    Removed 'Welcome' and 'Thank You' texts from
    survey. If desired, these can be added as
    questions with an 'N' answer type to the beginning
    and end of the survey. Results in the option
    for simple one-page surveys now.

    DB: Removed 'welcome_text' and 'thank_you_text'
    columns from 'surveys' table

    After completion of the survey, users can now
    be redirected to the main page, results page,
    or a custom URL.

    DB: Added 'redirect_page' VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    column to 'surveys' table

    TPL: Edited edit_survey_properties.tpl template
    to add input elements for 'redirect page'

  2004-05-15

    Added name of template to all Smarty
    fetch() methods to fix bug that did
    not properly load different templates

  2004-05-14

    Upgraded bundled ADOdb version to 4.22

    TPL: Modified some template names so that they
    were under 30 characters remove problems
    on some Apple systems

        Old Name => New Name
        edit_survey_edit_answer_type_choose.tpl => edit_survey_edit_atc.tpl
        take_survey_question_MatrixFooter.tpl => take_survey_question_MF.tpl
        take_survey_question_MatrixHeader.tpl => take_survey_question_MH.tpl
        take_survey_question_MM_Dropdown.tpl => take_survey_question_MM_D.tpl
        take_survey_question_MM_Horizontal.tpl => take_survey_question_MM_H.tpl
        take_survey_question_MM_Matrix.tpl => take_survey_question_MM_M.tpl
        take_survey_question_MM_Vertical.tpl => take_survey_question_MM_V.tpl
        take_survey_question_MS_Dropdown.tpl => take_survey_question_MS_D.tpl
        take_survey_question_MS_Horizontal.tpl => take_survey_question_MS_H.tpl
        take_survey_question_MS_Matrix.tpl => take_survey_question_MS_M.tpl
        take_survey_question_MS_Vertical.tpl => take_survey_question_MS_V.tpl
        edit_survey_edit_answer_type.tpl => edit_survey_edit_at.tpl
        edit_survey_edit_answer_type_choose.tpl => edit_survey_edit_atc.tpl
        edit_survey_new_answer_type.tpl => edit_survey_new_at.tpl

    Changed capture of IP address to $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']
    instead of $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'].

    Added checks for $_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'] and
    $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] when determining paths

    TPL: Minor layout adustments to edit_survey_new_at.tpl template
    to reposition input elements

    TPL: Minor change to take_survey_question_S and _T.tpl files
    to vertically position input elements.

    with separate SELECT and DELETE queries to make
    the script compatible with MySQL 3.23 and other databases

    Modified edit_survey_edit_answer_type template to
    include a count of all questions using the requested
    answer type. If the answer type is being used, a warning
    is shown detailing how changes will affect already supplied
    results of the survey. The answer type cannot be deleted
    if it is in use within the survey.

    Fixed bug that caused image selections to be reset when
    new answer values were added to answer type.

Version 1.02

  2004-03-15

    Added Affero General Public License, Initial Copyrighted Version

    Fixed bug in  take_survey_question_MM templates

    well as explanations of all actions
    and features.

  2004-01-31

    Added ability for administrator, once logged in, to
    take private surveys without supplying a password

Version 0.95.6

  2004-01-13

    Modified results page to look for "_left" and "_right"
    image in bar graphs (to allow for "rounded images").
    For example, an image setting of "bar.gif" will look for
    "bar_left.gif" and "bar_right.gif" and if they exist,
    put them on the left and/or right of the stretched bar
    graph image.

  2004-01-12

    DB: Changed answer_values.color to answer_values.image
        VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '' column

    Modified answer values to list images from the
    template image directory as possible bar graph
    images. Any file matching the "image_extensions"
    configuration setting is listed in a dropdown.

    Modified results page to use new, full image name
    and grab height from the image (so it does not
    change).

Version 0.95.5

  2004-01-09

    The following bug fixes deal with cleaning up
    the moving of answer types and values under
    a specific survey instead of being global.

    Fixed multiple bugs dealing with copying an
    existing survey. All questions, dependencies,
    and answer types and values are now copied
    from the old survey to the new one.

    Fixed bug that did not properly display
    dependent question numbers when editing a question

    Modified Delete Survey actions to also delete
    answer types and values associated with the
    deleted survey.

    Fixed bug in get_answer_values() method that
    prevented the correct values for the specific
    survey from being retrieved.

  2004-01-07

    Added question number to Text Results page

    Added display of total number of answers
    to Text Results page and each question

  2004-01-06

    DB: Added "sid" INT column to answer_types table

    Moved adding and editing of answers and values
    under the "edit survey" page and permissions.

    Answers and answer values are now related
    to a specific survey instead of being global.
    This change was made so that each survey can have
    it's own "yes/no" question and modify it without
    modifying the answer type or value for every
    other survey.

Version 0.95.4

  2003-12-16

    (more than three) from the "edit question" page

  2003-12-06

    Added ability to choose between 7 basic colors
    for the bar graph for each answer value

  2003-11-13

    Removed all demographics from survey.
    Demographics will now be added as regular
    MM or MS questions with the appropriate
    answer type and will enable them to
    have dependencies.

    Adjusted options on "view results" page
    to work from a dropdown box instead
    of individual buttons.

  2003-11-12

    Added removal of dependecies when deleting
    a survey.

  2003-11-04

    Added code to prevent the movement of
    questions up or down when it'll affect
    the dependencies of the questions. Also
    added checks so that page breaks cannot
    be deleted when they'll break dependencies.

    Fixed Bug #4, the answer value of 0 (zero)
    is now accepted.

    Fixed Bug #5, unchecked demographics
    are now deleted correctly when chosen
    to do so from the Edit Demographics
    page. Added multi-table DELETE query
    that is only compatible with MySQL 4.0.0+

    Added text filter to INI file. This is a
    comma separated list of words that will
    not be saved as answers if they are given
    as the sole text in text boxes. For example,
    answers such as "no" "n/a" and "none" will
    not be saved (for text answers) since they
    don't contribute anything to the results.

  2003-11-03

    Added ability to delete answers from the
    Edit Answer page.

    Fixed table references in queries that did not
    include prefix variable.

    Fixed Bug #3, dependencies based upon
    multiple choice or MM questions now
    work correctly.

    Fixed Bug #1, proper number of surveys
    that use the answer set being edited
    is displayed.

    Fixed bug in dependency logic preventing
    questions from being properly hid or required
    when dependencies were based upon two or more
    questions.

Version 0.95.2

  2003-10-29

    Added ability to hide question results from
    the survey results page

  2003-10-28

    Fixed bug that did not correctly remember
    demographic selections when coming back to
    them.

    Added feature to Hide or Require a question
    based upon answers to previous questions.
    Page break is automatically added if previous
    question is on same page. (Moving questions up
    or down or removing page breaks may break
    dependencies at this time.)

  2003-10-27

    Fixed bug that did not properly retain the
    chosen number of answers required when adding
    a question and an error occurred.

    Added ability to view results of surveys
    with answers "grouped" or "ungrouped"
    according to the groups set up when the
    answer type was created.

  2003-10-22

    Modified result viewing to do header() redirect
    to results page when password was POSTed to page.
    Prevents "Page cannot be displayed" errors/messages
    seen with some browsers.

    Fixed bug with viewing "sentence" results that
    referenced a table that was removed (results_char)

    Disabled showing "Next" button for text results when the
    number of answers retrieved from query was less than
    the limit for "number of text results per page" in
    the survey.ini file

  2003-10-21

    DB: Added `dependencies` table

  2003-09-29

    Added nl2br() function when displaying the
    text of the questions to preserve formatting.

  2003-09-25

    Modified creating survey, taking survey,
    survey results, and survey filters to work
    with new answer_values table.

    Moved tracking of all demographic questions
    to Questions table on page 1. Regular questions
    start on page 2. Moved storage of demographic
    results to Results table.

    DB: Deleted Demographics and Results_dg tables.

    Added get_answer_values() method to survey class
    to retrieve different answer values for a specific
    answer ID (aid). Function will run a query to retrieve
    values for the aid and store result in static array.
    Subsequent requests for the answer values will come
    from the array and will not trigger a query.

  2003-09-18

    Added JavaScript focus() call to admin_password
    text box on admin login page.

    Modified answer deletion code to work with
    answer_values table and pass message to template
    upon successful deletion.

  2003-09-15

    Modified adding new answer type to include a single
    text box for each answer and allow grouping of answers.
    Up to 99 answers are allowed for MM, MS, and D type
    questions.

    DB: Added answer_values table to database

  2003-09-12

    Added header and footer functions calls to
    new_answer_type.php

  2003-09-02

    Changed multiple calls of $smarty->assign() to
    $smarty->assignByRef() for performance increase
    for large arrays.

    Split edit_survey template into multiple templates, one
    for each area of editing (questions, demographics, etc)

Version 0.95.1

  2003-05-02

    Fixed bug that did not correctly copy first question after
    page breaks when creating new survey and copying existing
    survey

    Fixed bug that did not correctly move questions up in the
    question list

    Added addslashes() call to question text when creating new
    survey and copying an existing survey

    Added display of Demographics to "display answers" page

    Added code to make questions require an answer
    chosen when taking the survey. Uncommented code in template
    files to include "num_required" dropdown select box. Added
    "markers" to designate questions that were required when
    taking surveys or viewing results.

    Added validation to prevent the number of required answers
    for a question from being more than the number of answer
    blocks

Version 0.95

  2003-05-01:

    Fixed bug that would not remove all demographic questions
    if all demographic checkboxes were unchecked

    Fixed template error that would not allow users to take
    private surveys

    Fixed bug where results filter and filter text did not properly
    clear when empty filter form was submitted

    Added style.css and link in smarty/main_header.tpl file

    Changed name of survey2.inc to survey.sql.inc

    Added "Quit" survey button to final question page of survey

    Changed Entire "add survey" process. The initial create page will
    create a survey with default values and then redirect to the edit
    page for the survey. This stops what is basically a "duplicating"
    of code, one for creation and one for editing. The only drawback
    to this change is that more "blank" surveys could be created as
    people create surveys but do not add questions to them.

    Fixed bug that did not create page breaks correctly when creating
    new surveys by copying another

    Fixed template error that created incorrect link to "Return to
    Main" after completing or quitting a survey

    Added ability to move questions up and down in the survey from the
    edit page

    Survey System tested in alternate browsers including Netscape,
    Opera, Mozilla, and Lynx with no display problems except for one.
    Lynx will choose the first option of a radio button group as
    the default, even though no option was checked. This could lead
    to skewed results if people accept the "default" answer instead
    of taking the time to choose their own. All other browsers tested
    leave all radio buttons unchecked when loading the page.
