; the templates/ folder.

; Page Break Text
;
; This is the text the users will enter
; into the text box to create a page
; break in their surveys. The text is
; case insensitive.

;

; Image Width
;
; Width of image (in pixels) used

; survey results page
image_width = 200

; Filter Limit

; If the number of completed surveys returned
; from a filtered result set is less than or
; equal to this number, the filtered results
; will not be shown. This is to maintain
; anonominity because the answers could
; possibly be filtered such that the results
; from a single person could be identified.
; IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED YOU KEEP THIS
; THIS NUMBER AT 3 OR HIGHER TO MAINTAIN
; ANONYMITY.

; Track IP Addresses
;
; If set, the IP address
; of the user will be tracked in
; the 'ip_track' table. These IPs
; cannot be related back to the
; answers the user gave in any way.
; The program does not currently make
; use of the IP addresses, so you

; Text Filter
;
; A comma separated list of words that
; will not be saved in the database if
; they are the sole response in text
; answers. For example, if users just
; type "none" or "n/a" into the text box,
; they will not be saved. Leave empty
; to not filter anything from user's answers

; Text Modes
;
; The following two settings control the display of
; text provided as a part of the survey text (questions,
; answer values, etc) and as a part of the
; user-supplied text. Although the mode is
; controlled on a per-survey basis by it's
; creator, they cannot go over the setting
; you provide here.
;
; There are three text modes you can have
; in the survey system.
;
; 0 = Text only. All input is shown as plain text
; 1 = Limited HTML. <b>, <i>, <u>, <div>, <span>, <a>, and <img>
;     tags are allowed. All other tags are shown as plain text
; 2 = Full HTML. Text is shown as supplied
;     including any HTML, Javascript, images, etc.
;
; WARNING: Allowing FULL HTML is a security risk. You
;     are letting users write the HTML for the page
;     and they could introduce malicious code. It is
;     recommended that you never use Full HTML mode for
;     the user-supplied text and only use it for survey
;     text under very controlled situations.

; This format is also used to report the Survey
; creation date on the Edit Properties page.

; Survey Creation Access
;
; This setting will control whether the
; creation of surveys on the site is open
; to the public or restricted to administrators
; and the users they create and designate
;
; Options:
; public  - Anyone having access to the
;           site can create a survey
; private - Only administrators and designated
